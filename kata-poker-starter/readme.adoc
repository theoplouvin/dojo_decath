= QUICKSTART KATA POKER


== TDD

All kata should be made following TDD practices:

- RED
- GREEN
- REFACTOR

== Code provided
Just as  a quickstart for tests (avoid to create many boring code) and to have  common names
Code provided is :

- 2 enums for colors & ranks
- what is a card
- a few testing hands (should cover most of the tests)

== Playing the kata
For each new exercise :

- create the test
- make the code compile
- relaunch the tests
- refactor if needed
